▶️Guideline for Execution of the Project

Project Title: Smart Agriculture System for Organic Farming using AI and IoT

Step-by-Step Project Execution Guidelines
▶️Phase 1: Project Planning and Hardware Setup
Select the required sensors for soil moisture, light intensity, soil pH, soil temperature, ambient temperature, and humidity.

Setup Raspberry Pi Pico W as the microcontroller for data collection and transmission.

Establish Wi-Fi connectivity to enable real-time sensor data transfer to the Flask web server.

Calibrate sensors properly to ensure accurate readings.

▶️Phase 2: Backend and Database Development
Create a Flask-based Python web server to receive, store, and display sensor data.

Design SQLite databases:

user database for registration/login management.

sensor database for storing real-time sensor readings.

Implement API endpoints for:

Receiving sensor data via POST requests.

Sending sensor data to the dashboard via GET requests.

▶️Phase 3: Frontend Development
Design interactive web pages:

Home, Login, Registration, Dashboard, Analytics, About.

Integrate JavaScript and AJAX for:

Real-time table updates.

Dynamic sensor data visualization using Chart.js.

Add user-friendly navigation using a responsive navbar.

▶️Phase 4: Machine Learning & Analytics Integration
Define standard soil and environmental parameter ranges for organic farming.

Write suitability analysis logic to classify sensor readings (Optimal, Needs Attention).

Implement real-time analytics to:

Display statistical summaries.

Generate and download PDF reports of collected data.

▶️Phase 5: Deployment and Testing
Test the system locally for real-time data updates and stability.

Verify data integrity in the SQLite database.

Ensure secure user authentication and session management.

Prepare test cases for each functionality (data reception, dashboard update, analytics).

▶️Phase 6: Documentation and Presentation
Prepare final documentation including system architecture, workflow diagrams, and detailed explanations.



▶️Key Technologies Used
1.Python (Flask)
2.SQLite
3.HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
4.Raspberry Pi Pico W
5.Sensor interfacing via MicroPython

Note:
Maintain proper folder structures for code, databases, static files, and templates.

Ensure all dependencies are installed and documented.
